		<h1>Documentation Page for myFlix Movie API</h1>

		<p>In this project, I will be builing the server-side component of a movie database web application. This web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users can sign up, update their personal info, and create lists of all their favorite movies.</p>

		<p>We will be creating a REST API using the MERN stack. (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.JS)</p>
